# ✅ Yahoo Finance Migration Complete!

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your trading levels were showing **incorrect prices** because:
- Twelve Data API doesn't support futures contracts

- **ES futures**: ~$6,855 ✅ vs **SPY ETF**: ~$684 ❌ (10x difference!)
- **NQ futures**: ~$25,883 ✅ vs **QQQ ETF**: ~$500 ❌ (50x difference!)

```

### 4. Verify Prices

Compare your Initial Balance levels with [Topstep Daily Levels](https://www.topstep.tv/daily-levels/):

**Expected Results:**

## 📋 Symbol Mapping

| Your UI | Yahoo Symbol | Description | Contract |

| MES | ES=F | Micro E-mini S&P 500 | CME |
| NQ | NQ=F | E-mini Nasdaq 100 Futures | CME |

## 🗑️ Cleanup (Optional)

You can now **safely remove** the Twelve Data API key from your `.env.local`:

```bash
# This is NO LONGER NEEDED
# TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY=e2a1f44162d3483f9c8c4f3d1e4bf0e0
```

Yahoo Finance doesn't require any API key!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If prices still look wrong:

1. **Hard refresh your browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Clear Next.js cache**: `rm -rf .next`
3. **Restart dev server**: Stop and run `npm run dev`
4. **Check console for errors**: Look for API fetch errors
5. **Verify symbol mapping**: Ensure ES=F, NQ=F are being fetched

### If you see rate limiting:

Yahoo Finance may temporarily rate limit if you make too many requests. This is rare with normal use. If it happens:
- Wait a few minutes
- The app will fall back to sample data automatically
- Rate limits reset quickly (usually < 5 minutes)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with real trading sessions
2. **Compare levels** with Topstep or your broker
3. **Monitor console logs** for any errors
4. **Deploy to production** when satisfied
