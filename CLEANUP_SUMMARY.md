## 📚 Documentation Kept (Historical Reference)

These files **KEEP** Twelve Data references for historical documentation:

### ✅ **YAHOO_FINANCE_MIGRATION.md**
- Documents the migration from Twelve Data to Yahoo Finance
- Explains why the change was made
- Useful for understanding the evolution

### ✅ **DATA_SOURCE_UPDATE.md**
- Technical details of the data source change
- Problem identification and solution
- Comparison of before/after

These are kept intentionally as they document the **history** of the project and explain why certain decisions were made.

## 🗑️ You Can Now Delete (Optional)

If you haven't already, you can safely remove your `.env.local` Twelve Data API key:

```bash
# You can delete this from .env.local (it's not used anymore)
# TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY=e2a1f44162d3483f9c8c4f3d1e4bf0e0
```

The app will work perfectly without it!
