## Template for New Applications

### 2. Project Plan Template
**File**: `PROJECT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

This is a reusable template based on the IBLevels project structure. Use this as a starting point for planning any new Next.js/React application.

### How to Use the Template

#### Step 1: Copy the Template
```bash
# For a new project, copy the template
cp PROJECT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md /path/to/new-project/PROJECT_PLAN.md
```

#### Step 2: Replace Placeholders
The template contains placeholders in square brackets `[PLACEHOLDER]`. Replace these with your project specifics:

**Common Placeholders**:
- `[PROJECT NAME]` ‚Üí Your project name
- `[CORE FEATURE]` ‚Üí Main functionality
- `[TARGET USERS]` ‚Üí Your target audience
- `[PRIMARY DATA SOURCE]` ‚Üí Your data/API source
- `[FEATURE 1-6]` ‚Üí Your specific features
- `[X]` ‚Üí Numeric values (time, money, metrics)
- `[endpoint-name]` ‚Üí Your API endpoint names

#### Step 3: Customize Sections
Not all sections will apply to every project:

**Keep these sections** (universal):
- Project Overview
- Technology Stack
- Application Architecture
- Key Features Implemented
- Configuration
- Deployment Status
- Documentation Structure

**Optional sections** (customize or remove):
- Monetization (if not monetizing)
- Revenue Potential (if free/non-commercial)
- Marketing & Growth Strategy (if internal tool)
- Team & Responsibilities (if solo developer)

#### Step 4: Update as You Build
Use the plan as a living document:
- Check off completed items in checklists
- Update status fields as you progress
- Add new sections as needed
- Document lessons learned
- Track performance metrics

## Template Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "The app shows data"
‚úÖ Good: "The app displays workout history with progress charts for 15+ exercise types"

### 2. Set Realistic Goals
‚ùå Bad: "Complete in 1 week"
‚úÖ Good: "MVP in 3-4 weeks, polish in 2 weeks, total ~6 weeks"

### 3. Update Regularly
‚ùå Bad: Write once, never update
‚úÖ Good: Update weekly during development, monthly after launch

### 4. Include Actual Data
‚ùå Bad: "Some users visit the site"
‚úÖ Good: "127 users visited, 3.2 min avg session, 42% bounce rate"

### 5. Document Decisions
‚ùå Bad: Just list what was built
‚úÖ Good: Explain why you chose specific technologies/approaches

### 6. Keep It Accessible
‚ùå Bad: Technical jargon only developers understand
‚úÖ Good: Clear language that non-technical stakeholders can follow
