# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_SLOT=XXXXXXXXXX
```

3. **Environment variables must be set**
4. **App must be deployed** (not localhost)

### During Review:

- This is normal!
- Keep your site live and publicly accessible
- Don't modify ad code during review

### After Approval:

- Ads start showing automatically
- You'll start earning!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: Ads not showing

**Solution:**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly:
   ```bash
   # In Vercel
   Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_ID should be visible
   ```

2. Check browser console for errors:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for AdSense errors
   - Common: "adsbygoogle.push() error"

3. Verify AdSense account status:
   - Make sure site is approved
   - Check for policy violations

### Problem: Ads showing as blank

**Causes:**
- Site still under review (normal, wait 1-2 weeks)
- Ad blocker enabled (test in incognito)
- Insufficient traffic (AdSense needs some traffic)

**Solutions:**
- Wait for approval
- Disable ad blocker
- Drive traffic to your site

### Problem: "Ad slot not found"

**Solution:**
- Double-check `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_SLOT` value
- Make sure you copied the full slot ID
- Redeploy after updating environment variables
