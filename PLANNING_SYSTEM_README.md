## üí° Planning Philosophy

This template system is based on lessons learned from building IBLevels:

### 1. Document Early
Don't wait until the end. Document as you build.

### 2. Plan in Phases
MVP ‚Üí Enhancement ‚Üí Polish ‚Üí Growth

### 3. Checklists Are Key
You can't improve what you don't track.

### 4. Security First
Add rate limiting, caching, and security headers from day 1.

### 5. Performance Matters
Set performance budgets early and test often.

### 6. SEO Is Not Optional
Build it in from the start, not bolted on later.

### 7. Think Monetization Early
Even if you won't monetize immediately, plan for it.

### 8. Documentation Is Code
Invest time in docs‚Äîyour future self will thank you.
